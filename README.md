## ✨ What’s inside
- `notebooks/StressSense_End_to_End.ipynb` — The main notebook (EDA → preprocessing → 2+ models → evaluation → explainability → demo).
- `data/sample_stress_data.csv` — A tiny synthetic CSV to test the pipeline. Replace with your real dataset.
- `models/` — Saved model artifacts will appear here after you run the notebook.
- `artifacts/feature_types.json` — Auto-generated metadata for the demo UI (numeric/categorical columns, ranges, options).
- `app/gradio_app.py` — Launch a small UI to test predictions locally.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore` — Ignore bulky artifacts/venv.
